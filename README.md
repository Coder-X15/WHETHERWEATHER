# WHETHERWEATHER-
A Python-based weather application which runs on the OpenWeatherMap API

I created this program as part of my grade 12 computer science project. I hope to make improvements on the way as I am currently just a beginner in Python.

I hope you enjoy the program! Please do suggest some valuable tips!
